# Agent API

An agent works with a key that the principal or a reviewer creates in
**Team & safety → Agent keys**. The key is shown once; keep it in your agent's
secret store. The agent acts for the person who created the key and sees what
that person sees. It can read context and **prepare** work. It cannot approve,
change records or send anything: each preparation waits in **Preparations**
until that person approves or declines it, and the decision is recorded with
its result.

Send the key as a bearer token. Bodies are JSON.

```sh
curl -s https://YOUR-INSTALLATION/api/blotter/agent/context \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $BLOTTER_AGENT_KEY"
```

## Read context

`GET /api/blotter/agent/context` returns:

- `jobs`: each visible job's `id`, `title`, `period_start`, `period_label`,
  `due_date`, `status`, `client`, whether the client has a contact email
  (`has_contact`), `outstanding` document labels and `next_job_id` (set once
  the next period exists);
- `unbilled`: billable items not yet in an export, each with a `source_key`
  (empty for preparers);
- `commands`: the preparation commands below.

## Prepare

| Command | Body | On approval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/blotter/agent/prepare-rollforward` | `{"jobId", "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", "dueNote"}` | Creates the next period's job. `dueNote` says where the due date comes from; Blotter never computes it. |
| `POST /api/blotter/agent/prepare-reminder` | `{"jobId", "message"?}` | Issues a fresh upload link and mails the client the outstanding requests. |
| `POST /api/blotter/agent/prepare-export` | `{"title", "sourceKeys": [...]}` | Creates a draft billing export; the principal still approves it before any CSV exists. |

Roll-forwards and exports need a principal's or reviewer's key. Each command
returns `{"id", "kind", "status": "pending", "payload"}`. A revoked key, or a
person who is deactivated, gets `401` or `403`.
